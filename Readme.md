 -- ACR Payment Frequency App --

 This is a small application for a Car Loan company customer service representatives. It will help calculate the customer´s payments from 1 frequency to a different one; for example: from biweekly payments to monthly. The customer service representative usually does this manually and takes some minutes to calculate, adding a window for errors since it´s done while talking to the customer on the phone; this apps solves this problem using the correct amounts and helping the representative to focus on the conversation withthe customer instead of the numbers.

 On progress and for practice.
